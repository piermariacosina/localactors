		#title WHAT IS LOCALACTORS.ORG?
		#subtitle
			LOCALACTORS.ORG IS LAUNCHED AS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE TO HELP ANYBODY SUPPORT
			GOOD CAUSE - NON-FOR-PROFIT - PROJECTS
			AND TO HELP THOSE PROJECTS TO GET OFF THE GROUND.
		%p
			We believe in local communities and people active in them.
			They know their needs and can help themselves to care for them:
			let it be a school coach trip or a new dwell in a village. What they need
			is a little support in financing, knowledge or materials to get things going.

		#title THE LOCAL ACTOR
		#subtitle When you work on a local project you are a local actor.
		%p
			want you to have access to wide and passionate support.
			We start as a small group of those not happy with the options opened for small donors - 
			little transparency, no feedback and no visibility of what my contribution has done
			is most annoying. We also know a few project which are desperately looking for funding - 
			with the economic crisis that now drives them off from public funds as well as from
			bigger non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
