		#title Dear Friend!
		%p
			Welcome to LocalActors.org, a website to create a direct
			link between those who run projects and those who want to support them.
			Few of such websites exist, but none is focusing on local non-for-profit
			projects world-wide while giving a chance to wide range of set-ups.

	#section
		#subtitle If you (want to) run a project and would like to enter a new phase
		#subtitle look at our home page guidance and get in contact (MAIL).
		%p
			To publish your project we need description of it 60-100 words
			(what you want to achieve, when and how), support needed to accomplish the project
			(money, people, materials) and information about yourself. We will give you our dedicated
			support to prepare an attractive page on LocalActors.org website to raise funds.
	#section
		#subtitle If you know anyone who would like to use this website for his/her project,
		%p
			ask them to get in contact with us. We will help to prepare material to publish,
			to attract interest and funding.
	#section
		#title GLOBAL ISSUES - LOCAL ACTION
		#subtitle With economic recession all small and locally targeted projects are in danger
		%p
			yet there is a lot of will to keep the local action running! If you have a project,
			through LocalActors.org you can address small donors directly and world-wide. If you want
			to support a particular local project, you can choose to do so either financially, with
			human resources or your skills.
	#section
		#title TRANSPARENCY AND FEEDBACK
		#subtitle We want to support local action because we see the purpose and the result clearly
		%p
			At the same time we want to know what happened next; were the animals saved,
			was the school build? To join the local action, we all want to know where exactly
			the support goes and which specific benefits it brings.
