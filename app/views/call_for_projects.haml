				In May 2010 we would like to launch a project of starting a new production of organic Rosella tea on Lombok. Lombok is an island in Indonesia, situated next to Bali. In order to support jobs and create sustainable future for local families in the area of Ketara we need to kick-start production. We work closely with the University of Mataram and the Agricultural School in Bogor (Java) to make sure cultivation of a new plant in the area will work and the farmers are given specific training. The output of the production of organic Rosella tea - its distribution to primarily non-residential customers - will establish a small visitor's centre at the organic farm. By its "single commodity" system this will stimulate Eco Tourism on the island, where a new international airport just opened;  this is the real outcome we strive to achieve.

			The Foundation Kebon Sepatu is based in Netherlands and in Indonesia. It has launched already a second major project on Lombok, an island near to Bali. The families of the founders come from Lombok and the foundation is established on close work together with Indonesian and Lombok residents. Kebon Sepatu has currently twenty-seven members including voluntary staff, many of which are residents and some Board Members from the Netherlands spend several weeks a year on the island.
			The aim of Foundation Kebon Sepatu is to assist those who, through no fault of their own, but mainly through lack of choice and circumstances - have to deal with great disadvantages in educational, social, cultural, academic and economic aspects of life. The foundation is devoting its work to establishing better living condition for people on Lombok through sustainable local employment and training projects.

		#title NOW YOU CAN PROMOTE YOUR PROJECT
		#subtitle Social Networks
		%p
			You can use you're social networks (facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc.) to share your project on Localactors.org. Family and friends are usually the first way to spread your idea and connect with more people, enlarging the number of possible supporters.
		#subtitle Short and Simple	
		%p
			When you're promoting your project try to find few sentences to explain it in a simple and direct way. Sometimes people are a bit lazy or don't have time to read! They don't need to know immediately every detail about your project, it's enough to have a general outline of context and goals.
		#subtitle Enlarge Connections
		%p
			Find local channels (tv, newspaper, radio) to promote your project and raise local awareness and engagement. People can support you in many ways, not just with money, but also with skills, knowledge and promotion.
		#subtitle Don't Spam	
		%p
			While promoting your project try to keep it real, write dedicated messages and show the consistency of your project. Credibility is very important to have people believe in you and become active supporters.
